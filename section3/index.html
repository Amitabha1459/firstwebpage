	<h1>AUTUMN</h1>
	<p>Autumn (sharat) Lasts during Bhadra and Ashvin (mid-August to mid-October). This is traditionally the season when housewives put out clothes, musty and damp because of the rains, to air and dry in the hot sun of Bhadra. However, the bright day is often punctuated by sudden showers. The dark clouds in a grey sky, characteristic of the rainy season, are replaced by white clouds floating in a blue sky. Though at the beginning of this season, the days can be hot and sultry, towards the end of the season the nights and mornings become cool. The gradual decrease of humidity also makes the weather comfortable. During autumn a large number of fragrant flowers blossom: shiuli, roses, bakul, mallika, kamini and madhabi. The lotus grows in the wetlands and kash flower on the riverfronts. This is also the time when the palmyra ripens. A major Hindu festival durga puja is celebrated during this season.</p>
