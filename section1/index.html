	<h1>SUMMER</h1>
	
	<p><b>Summer</b> (<em>grisma</em>) Comprises <b><em>Baishakh</em></b> and <b><em>Jyaistha</em></b> (mid-April to mid-June), the two Bangla calendar months, when days are hot and dry. But the influence of summer is usually felt from mid-March. The heat of the sun dries up the waterbodies including the rivers, canals and the wetlands. The summer days are longer than the nights. At this time the southerly or southwesterly monsoons flow over the country. When dry and cool streams of air flowing from the west and northwest come in contact with rain laden clouds, storms occur, which, at times, take a violent form. These storms are popularly known as kalbaishakhi (norâ€™wester) or destructive Baishakh storm.</p>

	<p>The Bengali year begins with summer, with the <b><em>Pahela Baishakh</em></b> (first day of Baishakh) being the Bangla New Year. Hindus observe many seasonal festivals during this period, including  <b><em>jamaisasthi</em></b> (the sixth day of the bright fortnight in Jyaistha when a son-in-law is blessed by his parents-in-law). Summer is a season of fruits, with mango' [Am], blackberry' <em>[Jam]</em>, starapple' <em>[jamrul]</em>, jackfruit' <em>[Kathal]</em>, pineapple' <em>[Anaras]</em>, guava' <em>[Peyara]</em>, litchis, deuya (Artocarpus lacucha), watermelon, chalta (Dillenia indica), latkan (Baccaurea remiflora), palmyra' [tal], and hog-plum (amda) available in plenty. This is also the time when Roses, Bakul, Beli, Tagar and Jaba flowers blossom.</p>
